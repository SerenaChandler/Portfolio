## Summary of the assignment
This weeks assignment was to construct a portfolio. I kept mine pretty similar to the example funtionionally, but took some creative liberties design wise. I have links at the top of the page to navigate
the portfolio, which can take a viewer to a different area on the page. The areas are split into about me, a place to put my work, a section with a list of ways to contact me, and a spot for my resume,
whenever I actually get one.
